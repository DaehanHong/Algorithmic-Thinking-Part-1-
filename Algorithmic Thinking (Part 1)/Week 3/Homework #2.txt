The running time of CC-Distance is asymptotically slower than that of CC-Visited due to the initialization of dd in lines 2-3 of BFS-Distance.

(A^k)[i,j]

The length of the shortest path is the smallest non-negative integer k such that (A^k)[i,j] is non-zero.


(Ak)[i,j]?(A^k)[i,j] where kk is the length of the shortest path from node ii to node jj in g.
